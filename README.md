# Leetcode Solutions
This repository contains solutions to Leetcode code problems in numerical order. The sole purpose 
of this repository is to track my own progress and help others through my code.

The repository is in initial stage and later on I will also add README in each specific folder like my Project Euler repository.

## Introduction
Problem solving skill is similar to muscle building in gym, in order to improve one's skill constant practise with smart approach is required. After approaching and coding a problem from my own point of view I usually consult how others solved the problem and try to code it using a different approach.

## My goals and journey
For now I still consider myself novice as I need to learn a lot of things, its been a year and half since I started coding and only recently started competitive coding. There is still a long way to go.
